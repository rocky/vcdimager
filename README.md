This is GNU VCDImager, the GNU (Super)VideoCD authoring solution for
mastering, extracting and analyzing Video CDs and Super Video CDs.

Refer to the GNU VCDImager manual for more information.

For simple PBC-less VCDs the classic 'vcdimager' tool will be enough
(please note, that before 0.7.x the 'vcdimager' tool created a dummy PBC,
while the current 'vcdimager' does not create any PBC at all!),
but if advanced VCD features are needed, like menues, playlists,
additional entry points, auto pause points and so on, the XML based
tools are required to make use of. Examples and more information about
the XML structure in addition to the manual will be added on
http://www.hvrlab.org/~hvr/vcdimager/

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for general compilation and installation
instructions.

See the file BUGS for known issues.

The user manual is kept as texinfo documentation.
